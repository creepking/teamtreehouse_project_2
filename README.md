# teamtreehouse_project_2
The 2nd Project in the Team Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree
This project has 3 main parts: 1) calculating the amount of students that should be shown on each page, creating links at the bottom of the page based on the number of pages with which the list will be divided, and enabling links to the page that should correspond to the students that should be shown. The amount of students chosen here was 10, so each page would show a different set of 10 in those increments. The dynamic nature of the links is designed to work for any number of students.
